- Break-even: $${comprehensiveData.sustainability.miningEconomics.profitabilityMetrics.breakEvenPrice.toLocaleString()}

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write like a senior industry analyst, not a marketing bot
- Professional, engaging tone with specific data points
- Use industry terminology naturally
- Include specific company examples and case studies where relevant
- Focus on practical applications and real-world impact
- NO QUESTIONS OR CALL-TO-ACTION
- NO EMOJIS OR ICONS
- Tell a STORY, not just list numbers
- Be conversational and natural

EXAMPLE STYLE: "Bitcoin mining already transforms stranded energy into value; now, heat recovery takes it a step further. At Bitzero, our operational heat recycling program converts thermal energy into community heating solutions, monetizing what was once considered waste into applications like district heating for greenhouses, pools, food drying, and industrial processes."

IMPORTANT: Focus on the specific focus area (${content.metadata.focusAreas.join(', ')}) rather than generic Bitcoin metrics. Tell a compelling story about that specific aspect. Use numbers only when they support the narrative.
